# HanZip
- A program that compresses a text file using Huffman encoding
- It also decompresses a file that was zipped with the .HanZip format
- I will also add ability to encrypt the file (In progress)
## How to use
- Run from the command line with arguments
-  First argument is the path to the file
- Second argument is the command, either compress or decompress
- Only files that have been compressed with the .HanZip format can be decompressed
